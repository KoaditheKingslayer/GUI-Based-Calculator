# GUI-Based-Calculator
A simple calculator written in Python.

Known Issues:
- If a user clicks on an operator multiple times, it will correctly calculate the solution, however, following up with a number after this will have the number added to the input.
- No keypad/keystroke support.
- No entry filtering: Users can type whatever they desire currently, meaning they could add text into the calculator if they desired.

All of these issues are easily solved, if I decide to continue with this. This was more just me getting to work more with Python, to create a simple GUI project with Tkinter.
